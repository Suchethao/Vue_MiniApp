### Project Details

- **Why did you choose this subject?** 
  I chose this subject because Vue.js is a popular front-end framework that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. I wanted to gain experience working with this framework and understand how it can be used to build web applications.

- **How were you first made aware of it?** 
  I first heard about Vue.js from my brother who recommended it as a lightweight and powerful framework for building web applications.

- **What problem does it solve?** 
  Vue.js simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces by providing developers with a set of powerful tools and techniques. It allows developers to create custom components that can be reused throughout an application, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.
 

- **How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?** 
  Vue.js solves the problem of building complex user interfaces by providing developers with a reactive and composable framework for building custom components. It uses a virtual DOM to manage updates and optimizations, allowing developers to build responsive and efficient applications

- **Why does one use it?** 
  Vue.js is a popular choice for building web applications because of its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. It allows developers to build complex user interfaces with ease, and provides a set of tools and techniques for building responsive and efficient applications.

- **What are the alternatives?** 
  There are several other popular front-end frameworks available, including React and Angular.

- **What is it similar to, if anything?** 
  Vue.js is similar to other front-end frameworks like React and Angular, which provide a set of tools and techniques for building complex user interfaces.

- **What is the history of this technology?** 
  Vue.js was created by Evan You in 2014 as a lightweight alternative to existing front-end frameworks.

- **Who built it and why?** 
  Vue.js was built by Evan You, a former developer at Google, who wanted to create a simpler and more lightweight framework for building web applications.

- **Who is maintaining it?** 
  Vue.js is maintained by a team of developers and contributors, led by Evan You.

- **What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?** 
  Some of the biggest conceptual hurdles when learning Vue.js include understanding the component lifecycle and managing state across multiple components.

- **What resources do you recommend for interested students?** 
  For students interested in learning Vue.js, the official documentation is a great place to start.

- **What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?** 
  Official documentation, and Stack Overflow

- **What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?**
  1. What is Vue.js and how does it differ from other front-end frameworks?
  2. What are the key features of Vue.js and how do they make it easier to build web applications?
  3. Can you explain the component lifecycle in Vue.js and how it works?
